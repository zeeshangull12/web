<h3>  <strong> The Qur'an, the holy book of Islam, provides very little detail about prophet  muhammad ( s.a.w)’s life; however, the hadiths, or sayings of the Prophet, which were largely compiled in the centuries following prophet  muhammad ( s.a.w)’s death, provide a larger narrative for the events in his life (although there is significant debate in the Muslim world as to which Hadiths are accurate). 
prophet  muhammad ( s.a.w) was born in 570 C.E. in Mecca, and his early life was unremarkable. He married a wealthy widow named Khadija who was 15 years older and his employer. Around 610 C.E., prophet  muhammad ( s.a.w) had his first religious experience, where he was instructed to recite by the Angel Gabriel. After a period of introspection and self-doubt, prophet  muhammad ( s.a.w) accepted his role as God’s prophet and began to preach word of the one God, or Allah in Arabic. His first convert was his wife.
prophet  muhammad ( s.a.w)'s divine recitations form the Qur'an and are organized into books (surahs) and verses (ayat). Because these revelations focused on a form of monotheism considered threatening to Mecca's ruling tribe (the Quraysh), which prophet  muhammad ( s.a.w) was a part of, the early Muslims faced significant persecution. Eventually in 622, prophet  muhammad ( s.a.w) and his followers fled Mecca for the city of Yathrib, which is known as Medina today, where his community was welcomed. This event is known as the Hijra, or emigration. 622, the year of the Hijra (A.H.), marks the beginning of the Muslim calendar, which is still in use today.
Between 625–630 C.E., there were a series of battles fought between the Meccans and prophet  muhammad ( s.a.w) and the new Muslim community. Eventually, prophet  muhammad ( s.a.w) was victorious and reentered Mecca in 630.
One of prophet  muhammad ( s.a.w)'s first actions was to purge the Kaaba of all of its idols (before this, the Kaaba was a major site of pilgrimage for the polytheistic religious traditions of the Arabian Peninsula and contained numerous idols of pagan gods). The Kaaba is believed to have been built by Abraham (or Ibrahim as he is known in Arabic) and his son, Ishmael. The Arabs claim descent from Ishmael, the son of Abraham and Hagar. The Kaaba then became the most important center for pilgrimage in Islam.
In 632, prophet  muhammad ( s.a.w) died in Medina. Muslims believe that he was the final in a line of prophets, which included Moses, Abraham, and Jesus.
After prophet  muhammad ( s.a.w)'s Death
The century following prophet  muhammad ( s.a.w)’s death was dominated by military conquest and expansion. prophet  muhammad ( s.a.w) was succeeded by the four “rightly-guided” Caliphs (khalifa or successor in Arabic): Abu Bakr (632–34 C.E.), Umar (634–44 C.E.), Uthman (644–56 C.E.), and Ali (656–661 C.E.). The Qur'an is believed to have been codified during Uthman’s reign. The final caliph, Ali, was married to Fatima, prophet  muhammad ( s.a.w)’s daughter and was murdered in 661. The death of Ali is a very important event; his followers, who believed that he should have succeeded prophet  muhammad ( s.a.w) directly, became known as the Shi’a ("party" or "followers"), referring to the followers of Ali. Today, the Shi’ite community is composed of several different branches, and there are large Shia populations in Iran, Iraq, and Bahrain. The Sunnis, who do not hold that Ali should have directly succeeded prophet  muhammad ( s.a.w), compose the largest branch of Islam; their adherents can be found across North Africa, the Middle East, as well as in Asia and Europe.
